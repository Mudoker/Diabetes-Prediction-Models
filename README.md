# COSC 2753 - Machine Learning

## _Assignment 1 - Patient Diabetes Prediction_

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on a provided dataset. By analyzing various patient characteristics, the model can learn patterns that differentiate diabetic and non-diabetic individuals
